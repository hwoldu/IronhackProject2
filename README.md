# SZNal 

SZNal is a project that was born during our studies in IronHack Paris. It is a project made by Helen Woldu and Chlo√© Hipeau-Disko.

Conscious that most people living in cities don't know which fruit or vegetable is seazonal, and in order to offer recipes only with local vegetables (for France), we decided to create SZNal.

SZNal is a website that shows only seasonal recipes of local products. The design is changing through seasons and with it, the products and the recipes you see.
